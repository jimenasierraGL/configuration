server:
  port: 8080 #the default port used for zuul service

# Option 1: Routing via url:
# These simple url-routes do not get executed as a HystrixCommand, nor do they load-balance multiple URLs with Ribbon
# It just take all request to the path echo/ and fordward to the server localhost:8091
#zuul:
#  ignoredServices: '*'
#  routes:
#    test-service:
#       path: /test/**
#       url: http://localhost:8081

#Option 2: Chapter 5 - Another method is specifying a service-route and configuring a Ribbon client for the serviceId (doing so requires disabling Eureka support in Ribbon)
zuul:
  routes:
    echo-service:
      path: /test
      serviceId: test-service
ribbon:
  eureka:
    enabled: false

echo-service:
  ribbon:
    listOfServers: http://localhost:8081
